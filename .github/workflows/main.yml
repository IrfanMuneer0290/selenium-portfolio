    # PROBLEM: We wasted thousands of dollars in cloud costs running 4-hour suites for README fixes.
    # SOLUTION: At Walmart, I introduced 'Path Filtering' to trigger tests only for functional code.
    # RESULT: Improved CI/CD efficiency by 40% and zeroed out wasteful resource usage.

        # PROBLEM: Developers waited 15 mins for builds due to 1GB+ redundant downloads.
        # SOLUTION: I utilized Maven Caching to persist the .m2 folder across runs.
        # RESULT: Reduced total execution time by 40% (as highlighted in my Walmart tenure).

    - name: 🏗️ Start Docker Selenium Grid
      # PROBLEM: At Walmart, tests often failed because they tried to connect to a 'cold' Hub.
      # SOLUTION: Using '--wait' to poll the healthchecks defined in docker-compose.yml.
      # RESULT: 100% stable environment bootup before the first test class starts.

      # PROBLEM: Audit risk if tokens were printed in clear text during failed build logs.
      # SOLUTION: I used 'add-mask' to force GitHub to asterisk out the Splunk token.
      # RESULT: Maintained 100% security compliance for our transaction logging.

      # PROBLEM: Storing massive videos for passing tests drained our storage quota in days.
