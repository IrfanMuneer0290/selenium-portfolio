    # PROBLEM: We wasted thousands of dollars in cloud costs running 4-hour suites for README fixes.
    # SOLUTION: At Walmart, I introduced 'Path Filtering' to trigger tests only for functional code.
    # RESULT: Improved CI/CD efficiency by 40% and zeroed out wasteful resource usage.

        # PROBLEM: Developers waited 15 mins for builds due to 1GB+ redundant downloads.
        # SOLUTION: I utilized Maven Caching to persist the .m2 folder across runs.

      # PROBLEM: At Walmart, tests often failed because they tried to connect to a 'cold' Hub.
      # SOLUTION: Using '--wait' to poll the healthchecks defined in docker-compose.yml + extra verification.
      # RESULT: 100% stable environment bootup before the first test class starts.
